# Solution to Coding challenge

### Use of Services layer in MVC
The ```Services``` layer has been used to seperate data and business logic in two different layers. It can also be merged into Models.

### Frontend framework
[React](https://reactjs.org) has been used for this project with simple state management. For complicated structure Redux or Flux can be added later while adding complex component intewrations.

### CSS framework
[Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com) has been used for CSS.

### Data persistence
In memory for now. Ideally I'd have used a database.

### Unit testing
Unit test has been created for ```add car``` functionality, which is the only business logic in this scenario.

### Manually testing the ```api/vehicle/create``` endpoint
```api/vehicle/index``` can be used with a get request to test if the ```api/vehicle/create``` is working.
